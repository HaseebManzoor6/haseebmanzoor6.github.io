		<h1>Haseeb's Webpage</h1>
		I am a 4th year Computer Science/Mathematics student at the University of Toronto. Some of my interests include:
		<ul>
			<li>Operating Systems (Arch, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, FreeBSD)</li>
			<li>Cybersecurity (&gt;2yrs SOC experience in the manufacturing sector)</li>
			<li>Game Development (C++/SDL/OpenGL) and modding (hacking DOOM and other 90s games)</li>
			<li>Science Fiction</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Reverse Assembler</h2>

				I learned Rust by working on this project.
				It turns compiled code for any processor into
				readable assembly.
				I'm quite proud of
				how clean I kept the code, which is over 1100
				lines.
				<br>
				The full source code is available on GitHub:
				<a href="https://www.github.com/HaseebManzoor6/Reverse-Assembler">https://www.github.com/HaseebManzoor6/Reverse-Assembler</a>
				<h3>How does it work?</h3>
				I designed a scripting format to describe assembly
				languages.
				Instructions can contain data like memory
				addresses and constant numbers, encoded
				using logical operators like bitshifting.
				<br>
				<br>
				The script is used to create a series of nested
				hash tables
				that allow it to identify each instruction
				uniquely. This allows a disassembler to be created
				dynamically for any instruction set.
				<br>
				<br>
				If a file of compiled instructions is given (the
				<code>text</code> portion of an executable binary),
				it will be disassembled. This takes 2 passes
				over the file (one to generate branch labels),
				and is very fast: over 2.6 million 32bit instructions
				per second.
				<h3>Future Plans</h3>
				At some point I plan to expand this project with re-assembling.
				After that it could be used to explore some really interesting ideas
				of translating a compiled program to a different architecture.

		<h2>Custom *nix Desktop</h2>

			</div>
			<div class="projectdesc">
				This is my custom desktop environment for Unix-like operating systems
				(Linux or BSD primarily). It features a window manager, terminal, and application launcher.
				This project is a collection of my own personal forks of
				<a href="https://www.suckless.org">suckless.org</a>
				projects, with source code modifications/patches maintained by me in the C language.
				<br>
				<br>
				This has been my daily-driver for about 2 years of school and personal use now.
				It is easy to setup and use on Arch, Gentoo, and FreeBSD.
				<br>
				<br>
				I prefer to use a minimalist desktop environment for a few reasons.
				Using a minimalist operating system helps me appreciate
				how much work goes into every computer system, in a time where many of us have 3+
				phones/tablets/laptops on hand every day.
				I believe tech literacy is crucial for everyone in today's world, as
				more and more people become reliant on technology without anyone to teach them
				how it works under the hood.
				<br>
				I also appreciate the reduced code complexity of
				<a href="https://www.suckless.org">suckless.org</a>
				projects, as it ensures easy maintenance and makes security vulnerabilities easy to identify
				and patch.
				<br>

		<h2>Attachment - Puzzle/Dating Sim Game</h2>

			<div class="projectdesc">
				This was a game we made in a team of 4, part
				dating sim and part Boggle (the word finding puzzle
				game). It stars Clippy, everyone's favourite
				sentient paperclip.
				A fun project to work on.
				<br>
				<br>
				It was made in Java using JavaFX. My contributions included an
				option to control the Boggle game by keyboard instead of mouse, adding fancy
				backgrounds and a Windows 95 aesthetic, and implementing save files.

		<h2>Pacman AI</h2>

				</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="projectdesc">
				This is an AI algorithm I wrote to solve Pacman-style mazes.
				<br>
				<br>
				Initially, it used simpler AI algorithms like breadth-first and depth-first search.
				To make things faster I implemented A* heuristic search, and compared several
				heuristics.
				Some of the better ones included the smallest Manhattan or Euclidean distance from
				Pacman to the nearest food pellet, and the distance from Pacman to the corners of the map.
